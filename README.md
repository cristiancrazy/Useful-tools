**Generate a vector or a square matrix of integer/double and export it on a .csv file.**

You can set the range of the number generated, the separator type(; or ,)
and you are also allowed to choose to erase results, 
overwrite results or append results at the end of the file.  *You will find this tool under the folder "Rand CSV Generator".*

**This tool uses a lot of RAM during the results generation.**
